# Email_Verifier
This code is a command-line tool developed for the SyberBurger Community that takes user input of domain names and performs checks on them, such as verifying MX, SPF, and DMARC records. It then writes the results to a CSV file named "res.csv," indicating whether the domain has MX, SPF, DMARC records, and whether it is a valid email domain.
